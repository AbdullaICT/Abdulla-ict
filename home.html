I decided to create this website to distribute a wide variety of information to help keep you the user safe on the internet, stopping others from taking advantage of you so we will be talking about two main threatening things which hackers can do to gain <u> both informational and security advantage </u> on you. </font>

</br> </br> </br> </br> 

<font size="6"> informational threats </font>

<font size="5"> <u> Phishing: </u> is a type of scam where the scammers disguise themselves as trustworthy source in an attempt to obtain private information such as passwords, credit card information, etc. through the internet. These fake websites are often designed to look identical to their legitimate counterparts to avoid suspicion from the user. Normally, hackers will send third-party email to target requesting personal information, and they will use this as an entry point to implement attack </font>

</br> </br> </br> </br> 

<font size="5"> <u> malware: </u> particularly spyware, is malicious software designed to collect and transmit private information, such as passwords, without the user's consent or knowledge. They are often distributed through e-mail, software, and files from unofficial locations. Malware is one of the most prevalent security concerns as often it is impossible to determine whether a file is infected, regardless of the source of the file. </font>

</br> </br> </br> </br> 

<font size="6"> <u> personal safety </u> includes many threats but we will talk about only 4 </font> </br>
<font size="5" color="orange"> <UL>
<li> cyberstalking </li> </br>
<li> cyberbullying </li> </br>
<li> online predation and grooming </li> </br>
<li> offensive content </li> </br>
</font> </UL>

</br> </br> </br>

<font size="5"> <u> cyberstalking: </u> the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization.[6] It may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass. Cyberstalking is a crime in which someone harasses or stalks a victim using electronic or digital means, such as social media, email, instant messaging (IM), or messages posted to a discussion group or forum. ... The terms cyberstalking and cyberbullying are often used interchangeably. </br> </br> </br> 

<u> cyberbullying: </u> is the use of electronic means such as instant messaging, social media, e-mail and other forms of online communication with the intent to abuse, intimidate, or overpower an individual or group </br> </br> </br>

<u> Online predation: </u> is the act of engaging an underage minor in inappropriate sexual relationships through the internet. Online predators may attempt to initiate and seduce minors into relationships through the use of chat rooms or internet forums </br> </br> </br> 


<u> Online grooming: </u> usually refers to child sexual abuse but can also refer to radicalisation, drug trafficking, and financial gain. Grooming is when a stranger targets a child by befriending them and gaining their trust. Once they gain this trust, the groomer can manipulate the child to do what they want, which may include sending sexual images, running drugs, or any number of other activities
